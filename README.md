# lanyonwp

A WordPress theme based on Lanyon.

This is an attempt make a WordPress theme from Lanyon. Lanyon is a theme for Jeckyll (http://lanyon.getpoole.com/)

As far as I'm concerned it's about 95% finished; there's 5% of rough edges that need to be polished... But I don't really work on this any more, it was just for fun/learning.

The theme's color scheme can be changed in the customizer.
