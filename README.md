# lanyonwp

lanyonwp is a WordPress theme based on the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme for Jekyll -- it's an attempt to port Lanyon to WordPress.

Lanyon's eight optional color schemes are included and can be changed in the customizer. (In the WP admin, go to Appearance -> Customize -> Colors and choose from the "Theme Color" dropdown.)
